## Hello World üëã,

Every wondered if you can super-charge your API development and integrations workflow with API mocking, intercepting, proxing and local tunneling?

There exactly [Beeceptor üêù](https://beeceptor.com/) helps you. 

### API Mocking

* You get a dedicated sub-domain to be used as API endpoint. Life is easy with `200 OK`!
* Create mocking rules and send any kind of HTTP, API, web-services response.
* Match requests using request path, or request body.
* Simluate slow APIs or timeouts. This will help you discover unreachable paths.
* Use advanced (handlebar and FakerJs) templates to build your near real API respose.
* CORS just works out of the box.

### HTTP Intercept and Inspect

* Intercept all traffic to this endpoint in realtime. No need to refresh the page to get new requests.
* Inspect HTTP headers, 
* Supports HTTP, HTTPs and HTTP/2.

### Reverse Proxy

* Use Beeceptor as reverse proxy and intercept all the API traffic.
* Review HTTP headers, request and response bodies, etc.
* Use mocking rules to sent simulated response for new paths, and hit the target domain for the rest of them.
* Disable all mocking rules with single click and compare.

### Local Tunneling

* Expose your local port to the world using local tunneling.
* Configure Beeceptor endpoint as webhook destination, and use it for local development.

### Integrate in your CI

* Use Beeceptor APIs and integrate with your CIs to validate with confidance.
* Check if the downstream API was really called with required parameters.
* Simluate downstream API failures and delays.
* Save on cost by mocking external/vendor/service cost. Mock their reuqest and simluate response.

[Try Beeceptor üêù](https://beeceptor.com/?utm_source=github-profile)

### API Mocking

* You get a dedicated sub-domain as your API endpoint.
* Create rules to mock responses for HTTP or API requests.
* Match requests by URL path or body.
* Simulate slow APIs and timeouts to test different scenarios.
* Use template tools like Handlebars and FakerJS to build realistic API responses.
* CORS works out of the box.

### HTTP Interception and Inspection

* Intercept all traffic to your endpoint in real-time.
* Inspect HTTP headers and request data.
* Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2.

### Reverse Proxy

* Use Beeceptor as a reverse proxy to monitor and intercept API traffic.
* Review headers, request and response bodies.
* Mock new endpoints while forwarding other requests to the original domain.
* Disable mocking rules with a single click.

### Local Tunneling

* Share your local server with the world through Beeceptor's local tunneling.
* Set up your Beeceptor endpoint as a webhook for local development.

### CI Integration

* Use Beeceptor APIs with your CI pipelines to test calls to downstream services.
* Verify if the downstream API was called with the right parameters.
* Simulate downstream API failures and delays.
* Save costs by mocking external or third-party API requests.
